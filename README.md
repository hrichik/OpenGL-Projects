# OpenGL-Projects

These are a couple of my school projects for OpenGL. Unfortunately, other school projects could not be found as my old computer is completely broken and the files are inaccessible. The segments of code below are from my OpenGL Course, and showcases some work done in terms of rendering/creating 3D components. I also could not include dependencies in each project, as there were too many files and would not transfer to github.
